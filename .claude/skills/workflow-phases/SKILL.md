# Workflow Phases Skill

## Purpose

Provides HestAI workflow phase sequence, agent assignments, entry requirements, and deliverables for D0→D1→D2→D3→B0→B1→B2→B3→B4→B5 phases. Essential for phase navigation and transition validation.

## When to Use This Skill

Auto-activates when:
- Starting new phase (D1, D2, D3, B0-B5)
- Determining next steps in workflow
- Phase transition validation
- "What phase am I in?"
- "What comes after B2?"
- Workflow sequence questions

## Coordination Discovery Pattern

**ALWAYS check for coordination first:**
```bash
if [ -e ".coord" ]; then
  COORD=$(readlink .coord)
elif [ -d "coordination" ]; then
  COORD="./coordination"
elif [ -d "../../../coordination" ]; then
  COORD="../../../coordination"
else
  echo "WARNING: No coordination found"
fi
```

**Read status before any work:**
```bash
Read("$COORD/PROJECT_STATUS.md")
# Extract: Current Phase: [phase]
# Extract: Active Issues: [list]
# Extract: Blocking Issues: [list]
```

---

## Project Structure Template

```
{project-name}/
├── build/              # Development (worktree)
│   └── .coord → ../coordination
├── staging/            # Staging deployment
│   ├── claude_desktop_config_staging.json
│   └── .coord → ../coordination
├── production/         # Production deployment
│   ├── claude_desktop_config.json
│   └── .coord → ../coordination
└── coordination/       # All documentation
    ├── workflow-docs/  # Phase deliverables (D1, D2, D3, B0)
    ├── phase-reports/  # Phase reports (B1-B4)
    ├── planning-docs/  # CHARTER, ASSIGNMENTS, PROJECT-CONTEXT
    └── ACTIVE-WORK.md  # Status board
```

## Phase Transition Validation

### Before Starting Phase

**Checklist**:
1. ✅ Previous phase deliverable complete
2. ✅ Entry requirements met
3. ✅ Coordination context read
4. ✅ Current phase understood
5. ✅ Lead agent identified

### Before Completing Phase

**Checklist**:
1. ✅ Deliverable created and documented
2. ✅ Quality gates passed (where applicable)
3. ✅ Phase report written
4. ✅ Next phase entry requirements met
5. ✅ Handoff to next lead agent prepared

## Common Phase Transitions

### D3 → B0 → B1
```bash
# D3 complete: Blueprint created in coordination/
# B0: Validate blueprint, GO/NO-GO decision
# B1: Create build plan, setup workspace
# B1 Migration Gate: Move D3 Blueprint to dev/docs/architecture/
```

### B1 → B2
```bash
# B1 complete: Workspace ready, quality gates passing
# Verify: npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test → ALL PASSING
# B2: Start implementation with TDD
```

### B2 → B3 → B4
```bash
# B2 complete: Features implemented, tests passing
# B3: Integration and system testing
# B4: Package for delivery, documentation finalized
```

### B4 → B4_D1 → B4_D2 → B4_D3
```bash
# B4 complete: Production-ready package
# B4_D1: Deploy to staging, validate
# B4_D2: Deploy to production
# B4_D3: Operational confirmation
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Work stops when user unavailable** (no assumptions)
2. **Read coordination before ANY work**
3. **Phase deliverables are mandatory** (no skipping)
4. **Quality gates must pass** before phase transitions
5. **B1 migration gate** requires human checkpoint
6. **B4_DEPLOY required** for ALL deployments
7. **B5 scope limited** to ≤3 days or new project

---

## Agent Invocation Pattern

**ALWAYS include context:**
```python
Task(subagent_type="agent-name",
     prompt="""
     CONTEXT PATHS:
     - Protocols: /Users/shaunbuswell/.claude/protocols/
     - Workflow: /Volumes/HestAI/docs/workflow/001-WORKFLOW-NORTH-STAR.md
     - Coordination: {readlink .coord || ./coordination}
     - Current Phase: {from PROJECT_STATUS.md}

     TASK: [actual task description]
     """)
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Phase sequence**: D0→D1→D2→D3→B0→B1→B2→B3→B4→B4_D1→B4_D2→B4_D3→B5
2. **Lead agents assigned**: Each phase has designated lead agent
3. **Entry requirements mandatory**: Cannot skip phase prerequisites
4. **Deliverables required**: Each phase produces specific artifact
5. **Coordination first**: Always read PROJECT_STATUS.md before work
6. **B1 migration gate**: Human checkpoint moves D3 Blueprint
7. **Quality gates critical**: B1→B2 requires passing tests
8. **Deployment structured**: B4_DEPLOY phases for all deployments
9. **B5 scope limited**: ≤3 days or start new project
10. **Phase transitions validated**: Checklist before starting/completing
