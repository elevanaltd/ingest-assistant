  # Word Preferences (synonym mapping)
  # If AI suggests the key term, it will be replaced with the value
  wordPreferences:
    faucet: tap
    basin: sink
    stovetop: cooktop
    range: stove

  # Shot Types (controlled vocabulary - enforced in UI)
  # AI must select from these options, user can change via dropdown
  shotTypes:
    # Static shots (no camera movement)
    static:
      - WS      # Wide shot - shows full scene/context
      - MID     # Midshot - partial scene, main subject visible
      - CU      # Close up - detail focus
      - UNDER   # Underneath angle - shot from below

    # Movement shots (camera movement or focus change)
    moving:
      - FP      # Focus pull - rack focus effect
      - TRACK   # Tracking - following subject with gimbal/camera movement
      - ESTAB   # Establishing - scene reveal via pan/tilt/slider

  # Custom AI Instructions
  # Free-form guidance for the AI analysis
  aiInstructions: |
    Analyze the image/video and generate metadata following this structured pattern:
    {location}-{subject}-{shotType}

    Guidelines:
    - Location: Identify the space/room where the shot takes place
    - Subject: Identify the main object or feature being captured
    - Shot Type: Determine the framing and movement category

    For photos and static video shots, use: WS, MID, CU, or UNDER
    For video with camera movement, use: FP, TRACK, or ESTAB

    Example outputs:
    - "kitchen-oven-CU" (close up of kitchen oven)
    - "bathroom-shower-MID" (midshot of bathroom shower)
    - "living-room-window-TRACK" (tracking shot following through living room window)

    Use the word preferences to ensure consistent terminology.
